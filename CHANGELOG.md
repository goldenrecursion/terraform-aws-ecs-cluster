## 4.0.0 (May 27th, 2021)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* This module is now compatible with Terraform 0.14 and higher.

## 0.2.6 (December 31st, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* The `associate_public_ip_addresses` variable allows public IPs to be
  associated to ECS container instances. By default its value is `no`.

## 0.2.5 (December 31st, 2017)

IMPROVEMENTS:

* Updated README with correct inputs, outputs and usage.

## 0.2.4 (December 30th, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* The cluster now uses the latest ECS optimised amazon linux image by default.
  This can be overridden using the `cluster_instance_amis` variable.
* The `private_subnet_ids` variable has been renamed to `subnet_ids` as there
  is nothing requiring the subnets to be private
* The `private_network_cidr` variable has been renamed to `allowed_cidrs` and
  its type has changed to list.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* The cluster now uses the latest ECS optimised amazon linux image by default.
* The default security group ingress and egress rules are now optional and
  configurable. A list of CIDRs for both ingress and egress can be specified
  using `allowed_cidrs` and `egress_cidrs` respectively. The default rules
  can be disabled using `include_default_ingress_rule` and
  `include_default_egress_rule`.
* The security group ID is now available via an output named
  `security_group_id` so that additional rules can be added outside of the
  module.

## 0.2.3 (December 29th, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

* The configuration directory has changed from `<repo>/src` to `<repo>` to
  satisfy the terraform standard module structure.

IMPROVEMENTS:

* All variables and outputs now have descriptions to satisfy the terraform
  standard module structure.

## 0.2.0 (November 3th, 2017)

BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES / NOTES:

  generated names. The value that was previously used for name can now be found
  in the description.
